Cocos2d-AccelerametorControlTesting
===================================

A program aiming at helping you find out the most suitable accelerator control style.

Majorly, there are three types of control style. 

1. Mapping accelerometer value into acceleration.

2. Mapping accelerometer value into velocity.

3. Directly mapping accelerometer value into position.

This project aims at providing a solution for your app to choose the best control style. And for each controlling style, we have sliders to adjust parameters. 

Welcome to join me, if you think it will also help you. :)
